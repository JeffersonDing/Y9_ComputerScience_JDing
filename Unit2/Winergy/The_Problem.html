	  <h1>Outline of the Problem</h1>
	  <p>Climate change has now become the greatest threat to human nature. After long term study, scientists learnt that climate change in highly affected by human activity, especially by emitting a vast amount of greenhouse gases and other chemicals into the atmosphere which causes global warming. </p>
	  <p>Despite the data and warnings from scientists and climate activists, us humans are still burning fossil fuels and coal as our main energy source. Global carbon emissions hit an all-time high in 2019, at 36.8 billion metric tons(Harvey,2019).</p>
	  <p>Wind energy is one of the cleanest energy sources on Earth and only has a minor negative effect on the climate. All energy on Earth is created by the sun this includes hydro energy, geothermal energy, fossil fuels etc. but none of them could compare to wind energy in cleanness. Humans are finding a substitute for fossil fuels and coal but all other energy sources all have some sort of negative affect, for example, massive amounts of solar panels could decrease the albedo of the region and trap more heat, hydroelectricity plants could cause flooding, blockage of rivers and even harm the underwater ecosystem. </p>
	  <p>Since a wind turbine produces energy without any type of combustion process, it does not contribute to global warming by either rejecting waste heat or generating exhaust gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. (Niemi,2009) This is an ideal substitute for fossil fuels and the amount of energy produced has increased over the years and it’s taking a greater portion of electricity produced each year.</p>
    <h1>What Could Wind Turbines Do?</h1>
    <div class="description">
      <p>Wind energy is at the crest of initiatives to address global warming in the coming three decades. Investment in offshore wind was $29.9 billion in 2016, 40 percent greater than the prior year.</p>
      <p>32 turbines—each double the height of the Statue of Liberty—have been installed off the coast of Liverpool, England. Owned by Lego, the toy maker, this is an international effort: The blades are made on the Isle of Wight by a Japanese company for its Danish client, Vestas. Each turbine generates 8 megawatts of electricity; together, they will supply all 466,000 inhabitants of Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The wind industry is marked by a proliferation of turbines, dropping costs, and heightened performance. In many locales, wind is either competitive with or less expensive than coal-generated electricity—and it has no fuel costs and no pollution. Yet, not-in-my-backyard sentiment remains an obstacle in many places.</p>
      <p>The variable nature of wind means there are times when turbines are not turning. Wind energy, like other sources of energy, is part of a system. Investment in 24-7 renewables such as geothermal, energy storage, transmission infrastructure, and distributed generation is essential to its growth.</p>

		<div class="impact"><span class="impact-label">Impact: </span>For offshore wind, growing from .1 percent to 4 percent could avoid 14.1 gigatons of emissions. At a combined cost of $1.8 trillion, wind turbines can deliver net savings of $8.2 trillion over three decades of operation. These are conservative estimates, however. Costs are falling annually and new technological improvements are already being installed, increasing capacity to generate more electricity at the same or lower cost.</div>
